# Team 06 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
1. Work will be assigned during the weekly meetings in order to keep confusion to a minimum
2. For reassignments a member will state why they can't do what they were assigned and we'll talk out how to fix it.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
1. Have in person meetings 1-2 times a week
    * Constantly keep in touch on the TEAM06 Slack Channel
2. Upon the completion of a task the Gantt Chart will be updated with the corresponding information


## How will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
1. Utilize Slack to make other team members aware of the difficulties being had
2. If no response from Slack we each have our phone numbers listed for direct communication
3. Notify the team immediately on the day of the assignment of any known issues, constraints, or uncertainty before taking on the task.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
1. Once the team has been made aware of work difficulties, one of the following will occur:
   * A team member will be assigned as back up
   * The difficult work will be split amongst the team as a means to mitigate excess work
